  These are a bit longer than they should be. I usually wear a 9 but could have easily ordered a 8.5. The width is accurate.\n\nThe pink is even pinker than shown and the light gray is over the very bright pink so it isn't as gray as shown in the picture. It makes the shoe a bit overwhelming. Also two grommets on each shoe is dark. I'm not referring to the dark grommets closer to the toe as shown in the photo, I'm talking about two grommets up at the top of of the laces (opposite side of side shown in photo). I thought it was faulty at first until I noticed they were on the same side of each shoe. Kind of odd and not pictured.\n\nOverall,  these are a bit longer than they should be i usually wear a  but could have easily ordered a  the width is accuratennthe pink is even pinker than shown and the light gray is over the very bright pink so it isnt as gray as shown in the picture it makes the shoe a bit overwhelming also two grommets on each shoe is dark im not referring to the dark grommets closer to the toe as shown in the photo,   bit longer usually wear   easily ordered   width accuratennthe pink pinker shown light gray bright pink nt gray shown picture makes shoe bit overwhelming grommets shoe dark m referring dark grommets closer toe shown photo

  WOW!  I love these capris!  I ordered the deep teal and they are a very dark blue/teal (a much deeper prettier color than shown).  I received many compliments the first time I wore them to the gym.  They are super soft and comfortable from the leg all the way to the waist...COMFORTABLE.  They never slip down at the waist and give me full coverage (not see through at all). I am 5' 4\ and 159 pounds and I ordered a medium.  The size fit perfectly although that being said they are longer on me than the photo (probably my short legs) but came 2 inches above my ankle so just below my calf.  Given that I have weight to loose these are very flattering on as well.  They are also a nice stretchy fabric (thus the comfort) and cool.  We are in the high 90's and 100 degree summer weather and I am cool!  Purchase these as you won't be disappointed especially at this price.
